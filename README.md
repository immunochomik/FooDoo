# FooDoo
Is an cross between to do app and effort tracker, It should be easy to note what exactly I was doing whole day, these 
these notes should have categories so summaries of categories can be presented, eg in last month I have spent 43h on bugs,
12 on opps tasks, 60 developing features, I was working 30% of time on project A and 70% project B etc.

It is in browser app with otu any backend, well I will need to add some backend when FooDoo will be used for tracking team efforts
